 Description:
 Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to predict sales and improve business outcomes.In this article ,we will discuss how machine learning can be used
 to predict sales and the different methods that can be used to do so.
 One of the most common methods used to predict sales is regression analysis. This method involves using historical sales data to train a model that can predict future sales.
 The model can take into account factors such as past sales, marketing campaigns, and economic indicators to make its predictions.
 Types of linear regression:
 1. Linear Regression
 2. Polynomial Regression
 3. Stepwise Regression
 4. Decision Tree Regression
 5. Random Forest Regration
 6. Support Vector Regression
 7. Ridge Regression
 8. Lasso Regression
 9. ElasticNet Regression
 10. Bayesian Linear Regression
